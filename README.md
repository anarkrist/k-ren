Kris' Discord bot that can do pretty much anything any other bot can do

It's also been revived from 2 year old code so it needs major reworking to be like actually good even just as a template

# config.json
A config.json file in the project directory will serve as a configuration file for this bot.

This is where you need to put your bot token currently, and in the future will also configure other options (see TODO.md)

# Dependencies
[Node.js](https://www.nodejs.org/) (runtime, obviously)

[Discord.js](https://github.com/hydrabolt/discord.js/) 

`npm install discord.js` in project directory

# Licence
K-ren is licenced under the Apache 2.0 Licence in full, except for the art included in the README header, which retains  
copyright with the artist and the characters creator (albeit both parties are pretty relaxed on copyright.)
