Kris' Discord bot that can do pretty much anything any other bot can do

It's also been revived from 2 year old code so it needs major reworking to be like actually good even just as a template

# config.json
A config.json file in the project directory will serve as a configuration file for this bot.

This is where you need to put your bot token currently, and in the future will also configure other options (see TODO.md)

# Dependencies
[Node.js](https://www.nodejs.org/) (runtime, obviously)

[Discord.js](https://github.com/hydrabolt/discord.js/) 

`npm install discord.js` in project directory
