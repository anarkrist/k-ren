# K-ren
Kris' Discord bot that can do pretty much anything any other bot can do

It's also been revived from 2 year old code so it needs major reworking to be like actually good even just as a template

# .env file
A .env file in the project directory will serve as a configuration file for features added going forward (see TODO.md)

As of now the token can be configured by creating a `.env` file (this will be hidden on *nix systems) and setting `BOT_TOKEN`'s value;

`BOT_TOKEN='token'`
